"What is Financial Aid?
","Financial aid is federal and state government money that helps you pay for your educational expenses. It comes in two basic types – gift aid, which is given to a student without obligation, and self-help, which is either loans to be paid back or a work grant to be earned. Awards might be based on any combination of factors, including your grades, needs, talents, or circumstances. They can come from several sources, including federal and state governments and institutional aid.

Financial aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Salem State offers a combination of need and merit-based aid. For detailed information on the FAFSA, types of aid, and eligibility criteria, visit studentaid.gov.

What paperwork do I need to submit to counseling and health services before I arrive at Salem State?,"Complete all items on the health and immunization form, available as an attachment here. You can upload your immunization documentation and medical records directly to your student health portal. If you or your doctor attaches a copy of your immunization record to this form, please have it translated into English. All international students, regardless of the number of credits they are taking, must comply with the Massachusetts immunization requirements. For a list of required immunizations, please refer to the immunization requirements page. You can also access the forms and immunization requirements by logging into the health services portal from your Navigator account.",Health Services Requirements for International Students.csv
"How does healthcare work in U.S.?
","The U.S. health care system is different than in most other countries. Instead of socialized or government-paid medicine, each person has to pay for his or her own medical care such as the cost to see a doctor, obtaining prescription medications, having lab procedures done, and for expensive hospital stays. Health insurance helps cover the costs of such visits which can be from $75 for seeing a doctor to over $30,000 per day for admission to a hospital.

Without insurance, the person would be responsible for paying all of those costs. With insurance, the person would be responsible to only pay a portion (usually called a co-pay) for these costs. Therefore, it is very important and useful to have health insurance to help navigate and afford the U.S. health care system. Students should read and become familiar with their policy's terminology and benefits. Important words to know and understand are deductible, co-pay, co-insurance, preferred provider, primary care physician, specialist, in-network, out-of-network, pre-existing condition, and referral. If you are unsure about any of your coverage for seeing a specific doctor, contact your insurance company.

As an international student, it is important to know that the U.S. government does not pay any part of any medical expenses for international students and it is a violation of immigration laws for F-1, F-2, J-1, and J-2 students and their dependents to accept public assistance. It is important to sign up for an insurance plan prior to becoming ill or injured.",Health Services Requirements for International Students.csv
What type of health insurance plan do I need?,"Massachusetts state law requires all international students studying in Massachusetts to have health insurance, regardless of the visa or number of credits. To ensure that all students are provided the most cost-effective coverage, and to meet the Massachusetts state and U.S. immigration law requirements, international students must purchase the Salem State student health insurance plan.

If you are unsure of your status, please contact the bursar's office to confirm whether or not you can waive the Salem State student health insurance plan for this reason.

"If I get sick, what are some tips for accessing health care in the U.S.?
","For non-emergency issues during business hours, students should seek assistance from Salem State's counseling and health services first. For Salem State students, there is no cost to see a doctor or nurse practitioner at counseling and health services. There is a charge for some lab tests and some immunizations. If you need to see a specialist off campus, we will give you suggestions as to who you should contact. Your health insurance is for treatment that you receive off campus, or for lab tests you may receive at counseling and health services. The hospital emergency department should only be used for life-threatening injuries or illnesses.

-Students should always carry their insurance card. Most hospitals, doctors and pharmacies work directly with insurance companies for payment. Without the insurance card, students may be required to pay the cost themselves and then apply to be reimbursed by the insurance company.
